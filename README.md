# This is my second skill up task from antematter.


### This repo have 5 folders:

1. [ERC20_Tokens_Deployment](ERC20_Tokens_Deployment): In this folder I am creating token contracts, deployed and invoke for the use in swaping in [v2-periphery-deployment](v2-periphery-deployment).
2. [v2-core-deployment](v2-core-deployment): In this folder, I have take the contracts from uniswap v2-core and doing the deployment & invoking of that contracts.
3. [v2-periphery-deployment](v2-periphery-deployment): In this folder, I have take the contracts from uniswap v2-periphery and doing the deployment & invoking of that contracts.

## Skill up task 2

As part of the Solidity DeFi Skill up Task, you need to:
1.  Use UniswapV2 and deploy its smart contract on the Goerli Testnet.
2.  Create multiple ERC20 tokens.
3.  Create multiple UniswapV2 swap pools using the newly created ERC20 tokens.
4.  Use Javascript/Typescript to invoke your newly deployed smart contract and swap ERC-20 tokens using the newly created pools.
